# Razer Nari Battery Level
## Research
I wanted to check the exact battery level of my wireless Razer Nari headset. Official Razer Synapse software (BTW only available on Windows) only shows a graphical battery indicator which is not very informative.<br/>

Razer Nari communicates with a PC (host) through a USB dongle implementing some proprietary protocol in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.
With Wireshark and USBPcap I tried to observe frames exchanged between my PC running Windows and the dongle. I noticed that with Razer Synapse running every several seconds (sometimes tens of seconds) a recurring group of 4 frames occured.

The 1-2 pair is a request-response pair and such is the 3-4. I suppose that these frames have the following meaning:
1. 'SET_REPORT Request'<br>
The host tells the device to prepare a report describing its current state.
2. 'SET_REPORT Response'<br>
The device tells if it managed to prepare the report.
3. 'GET_REPORT Request'<br>
The device is told to present the report to the host.
4. 'GET_REPORT Response'<br>
The host receives the report.

I was decoding and observing data in subsequent 'GET_REPORT Response' frames. When the green LED indicating full charge switched on and I disconnected the charging cable, bytes 40-41 (counting from 0) formed value 0de0 (hexadecimal) = 3552 (decimal) and when the headset went dead, they were equal to 3320. It led me to a conclusion that bytes 40-41 contain the headset's exact battery voltage in millivolts.

I created RazerNariBatteryLevel program used to fabricate 'SET_REPORT Request' and 'GET_REPORT Request' which are normally performed by Razer Synapse. Then RazerNariBatteryLevel decodes two aforementioned bytes and presents them as decimal battery voltage in millivolts.

## Building
RazerNariBatteryLevel uses libusb which is a C library that provides generic access to USB devices. You can install libusb on Ubuntu by running:
```
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev
```
Then build RazerNariBatteryLevel with GCC:
```
gcc RazerNariBatteryLevel.c -lusb-1.0 -o RazerNariBatteryLevel
```

## Running
Connect Razer Nari headset's USB dongle to your computer and run RazerNariBatteryLevel:
```
sudo ./RazerNariBatteryLevel
```

### Usage example
How the USB dongle looks like.<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7i8HmNQ.jpg" width="500"/>

When the dongle is already connected to a PC but the headset isn't turned on yet, the dongle returns 0 millivolt battery voltage.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vE4Mpyl.jpg"/>

The headset has blue LED on shortly after it is turned on.<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G1DQzHR.jpg" width="500"/>

It turns off after connecting to the dongle.<br/>

The reading of a discharging battery decreases everytime by 8 millivolts.<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HeYQvFT.jpg"/>

When the charging cable is plugged in, the power supply pulls the voltage up to around 4.2 volts which is expected in order to charge a lithium-ion battery.<br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YcJ0ksX.jpg"/>

When the charging cable is disconnected, voltage drops to some value above that present when charging was started.<br/>
